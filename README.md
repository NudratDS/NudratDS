# **MARKETING SCIENTIST | REVENUE INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECT**

### I answer the only question that matters:
## **What should we scale, cut, or fix to grow revenue?**

</div>

## **THE PROBLEM WITH MOST MARKETING "DATA"**

Your dashboards show impressions. Your reports track clicks. Your KPIs measure vanity.

**None of it answers:** *Should we double Meta spend or kill it? Which customer segment actually drives profit? Where is revenue bleeding in our funnel?*

I build **Revenue Intelligence Systems** that replace founder intuition with statistical certainty.

## **HOW I THINK (THIS MATTERS MORE THAN CODE)**
```
Business Question → Data Exploration → Statistical Model → Decision Framework → Executive Insight
```

**Not:**
```
Data → Dashboard → "Insights" → Hope someone acts on it
```

### **My Principles:**
1. **Revenue impact > Model accuracy**  
   A 70% accurate model that drives decisions beats a 95% model gathering dust.

2. **Clarity > Complexity**  
   If a founder can't explain the insight to their team, it's useless.

3. **Decisions > Dashboards**  
   I don't build "analytics infrastructure." I build systems that tell you what to do next.

4. **Statistical rigor > Gut feelings**  
   But also: Don't let perfect be the enemy of profitable.
